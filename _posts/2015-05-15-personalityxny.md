Ever wonder what your personality is and how your personality is related to other things?
As a group of researchers interested in AI for scientific discovery, we are currently conducting research involving personality measures, physical features (palm print, height, weight, etc.), and demographical information.  We hope you can join us by completing the following survey.  You will get your personality testing result at the end of the survey, and we will also update you on the research findings as soon as they are clear.
 
We appreciate your time, your curiosity, and your contribution! <br/>
